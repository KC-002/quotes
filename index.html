                <h1>QUOTES BY MARCUS AURRLIUS</h1>
                <p>“You have power over your mind - not outside events.
                     Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>
                
                <p>“The happiness of your 
                    life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”</p>
                <p>“Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact.
                     Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”</p>
                <p>“Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be.
                     Be one.”</p>
                <p>“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to 
                    the thing itself, but to your estimate of it;
                     and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”</p>
                <p>“When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it 
                    is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...”</p>
                <p>“The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”</p>
                <p>“The soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.”</p>
                <p>“It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear 
                    never beginning to live.”</p>
                <p>“Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with
                     whom fate brings you together,but do so with all your heart.”</p>
                <p>“Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same 
                    weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.”</p>
                <p>“Our life is what our thoughts make it.”</p>
                <p>“Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault 
                    of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?”</p>
                <p>“If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, 
                    I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. 
                    It is the person who continues 
                    in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”</p>
                <p>“I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself 
                    more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own 
                    opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.”</p>
